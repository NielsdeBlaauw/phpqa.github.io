title: About Composer and PHARs

All projects have an installation section now.
 
<!--more-->

For now, however, only the official instructions are visible, as close as possible as they are mentioned
on all the websites, repositories, wikis and readme files, and only in the three most common ways:
using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and/or [PHAR](https://phar.io/)s.
There are more obscure ways mentioned now and then, and they will be added soon, for completeness sake,
but after today, I certainly am hoping at least one of the PHAR tools will make it through.

Cause yes, as [Stephan Hochd√∂rfer](https://twitter.com/shochdoerfer) mentioned,
we [do have a problem](https://blog.bitexpert.de/blog/solving-the-require-dev-problem/).

I certainly would love to add more secure instructions on how to download PHARs and packages in a verifiable way.

Let the era of a lovechild between [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and [PHIVE]((https://phar.io/)) begin!

Sincerely,
your buzzard.
