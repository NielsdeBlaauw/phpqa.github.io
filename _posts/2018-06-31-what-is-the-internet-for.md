Recently I noticed a change on the old PHP QA Tools domain "phpqatools.org".

<!--more-->

Where before was a simple page for PHP QA tools, now it is telling you to use virtual reality... for porn.
So I took down all the links to the old page. And if you still have a link to it,
you might want to update it to [https://phpqa.io](). But then again, that's totally up to you!

After all, I guess that [Avenue Q song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcN5CxO86qI) was right all along.
