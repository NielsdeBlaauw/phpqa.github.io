[{{ page.title }}]({{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}) is a unit test framework for PHP.

<!--more--> 

It is a PHP unit test and web test framework. Users of JUnit will be familiar with most of the interface. The 
JWebUnit style functionality is more complete now. It has support for SSL, forms, frames, proxies and basic 
authentication. The idea is that common but fiddly PHP tasks, such as logging into a site, can be tested easily.
