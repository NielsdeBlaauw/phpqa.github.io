<!--more--> 

A simple, modern and intuitive unit testing framework for PHP!

Just like SimpleTest or PHPUnit, atoum is a unit testing framework specific to the PHP language. However, it has been designed from the start with the following ideas in mind:
* Can be implemented rapidly,
* Simplify test development,
* Allow for writing reliable, readable, and clear unit tests.

It also allow out-of-the-box to run tour test into [different mode](http://atoum.org/features.html#execution-engines): in parallel, in concurency, or simply inline (one after one). And has several nice helps for the devloper in they day-too-day usage.
