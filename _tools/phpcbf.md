PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer is part of a set of two PHP scripts; the main phpcs script that tokenizes PHP, JavaScript and CSS files
to detect violations of a defined coding standard, and a second phpcbf script to automatically correct coding standard violations.
PHP_CodeSniffer is an essential development tool that ensures your code remains clean and consistent.
