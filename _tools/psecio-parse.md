[{{ page.title }}]({{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}) is a static scanning tool to review your PHP code for potential security-related issues.
 
<!--more--> 

A static scanner means that the code is not executed and tested via a web interface (that's dynamic testing).
Instead, the scanner looks through your code and checks for certain markers and notifies you when any are found.

**This tool is still in a very early stage. The work continues...**
